however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\xe9 Altafini\'s record from the 1962\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\xfcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\xe9sar Rodr\xedguez\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\'s individual form, Barcelona\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola \u2013 one of the greatest eras in the club\'s history \u2013 drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alc\xe1ntara\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Cl\xe1sico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di St\xe9fano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atl\xe9tico Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]",\n            "score": 0.97579,\n            "raw_content": null\n        },\n        {\n            "title": "The life and times of Lionel Messi",\n            "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4783674/2023/08/18/lionel-messi-profile-soccer/",\n            "content": "For Messi, it is major trophy number 44..
