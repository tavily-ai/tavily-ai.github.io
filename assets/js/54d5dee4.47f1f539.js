"results": [\n    {\n      "title": "Lionel Messi - Wikipedia", \n      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", \n      "content": "He scored twice in the last group match, a 3\u20132 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[423] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1\u20130 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1\u20130 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[424][425] Following a 0\u20130 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4\u20132 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\\'s first penalty.[426]\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[427] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. \\"[582] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi\\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[583][584][585] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[581]\\nComparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[586][587]\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[588][589] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[160] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d\\\'Or to Ronaldo\\\'s five,[590] seven FIFA World\\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\\'s four.[591] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[160][592] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1\u20130 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi\\\'s record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002\u201303 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe\\\'s top-five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace in a 5\u20130 away win against Alav\xe9s in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\xe9 Altafini\\\'s record from the 1962\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\xfcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\xe9sar Rodr\xedguez\\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola \u2013 one of the greatest eras in the club\\\'s history \u2013 drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alc\xe1ntara\\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Cl\xe1sico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di St\xe9fano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atl\xe9tico Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]", \n      "score": 0.98567, \n      "raw_content": null\n    },\n    {\n      "title": "Lionel Messi |
